### What is a Rich Internet Application?  

Much like every other term in software there are many interpretations of what a Rich Internet Application is. Here I will share with you my own interpretation of RIA and a subset of skills you might need to realize this interpretaion. Being involved in RIA since the term was coined in 2002 my interpretation of what it means has followed and evolved with the technology able to fulfil its literal meaning. The term is fairly self explanitory when take at face value :

* **Rich** - Referring to the user experience and user interface. An immersive, valuable, well rounded and powerful experience.
* **Internet** - Having something to do with the interwebz
* **Application** - A program designed to solve some issue, achive a goal, or otherwise engage a minimum of one intellegent user, human or otherwize.

		* [Pavlov Dog monitor Application](http://pavlovdogmonitor.com/pavlov-app/) which was shown in the iPad Lessons and is being extended as a treat despensor.

My interpretation of the way these three words define what we know as RIA is any program designed with a rich user experience that is either connected or has the ability to connect to the internet and was created using technology traditionally found online available via a browser. This means that for me, even if an app is offline, if it has the ability and potential intention to connect to the internet and communicate or utilize data over a network it is an RIA. This may also extend to applications comunicating on a local networkwhich has no true internet access, but would behave the same way if its netwrork communication were served from a remote server.
