### Some basic HTML tags or elements

`Tag` is a term referred to the text used to start an HTML `element`. Often times the words `tag` or `element` are used interchangeably. The following tags are formatted as :  
< `tag` > CONTENT </ `tag` >  
There are many more HTML tags than those listed below, but for now these are the ones we will be focusing on. If you would like to look at more detailed lists you can check out the [MDN HTML Element List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list). You will find [The MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) or Mozilla Developer Network will be an invalusable tool in the learning process and is very important even for the most experienced developers.
