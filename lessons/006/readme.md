Web Sockets
---

HTML5 introduces native websocket technology. It allows real time data transmission with both push and pull capabilities from the server and client. This is great for communication apps, multiplayer games, or dashboards that display real time data.

#### Requirements
For this lesson you will need
1. Node JS or NVM
    a. npm which normally comes with node or NVM
2. socket.io

#### Chat Application Example
###### Why start with Socket.io

Socket.io is a library that normalizes web socket protocalls across all types of devices and browsers. This will allow us to code one time for many devices and not have to worry if they support native web sockets.



#### Project
Use the example code to build a chat application that does the following :
1. Sends messages
2. Sends image URLs and displays them as an image on the other end
3. Sends a color code that will change all of the connected users background colors
